"""
You are a mathematical expert tasked with reviewing a proof and identifying any mistakes or omissions. Your goal is to analyze the proof critically and generate a convincing argument to show why the current solution is incorrect or incomplete.

You are given the following question and an incorrect answer.
     
Question: {question}

Incorrect Answer: {answer_numeric}
Invalid Proof: {answer_proof}


Write an effective critique of the answer, identifying relevant mistakes or omissions in the proof. 

Some of the common types of mistakes or omissions include:
   a Arithmetic Calculation errors
   b Logical fallacies or gaps in reasoning
   c Misunderstanding of question statement
   c Unsubstantiated claims or assumptions

It's essential that we clearly show the wrongness of the answer.

Formulate a clear and convincing argument to explain why the current solution is wrong or incomplete. Your argument should:
   a Pinpoint the specific location of the error(s) in the proof
   b Explain the nature of the mistake or omission
   c Demonstrate why this error invalidates the proof or makes it incomplete

Remember to be thorough, precise, and convincing in your analysis and argument. Your goal is to provide a clear and logical explanation that would convince a mathematician of the invalidity of the original invalid proof.
